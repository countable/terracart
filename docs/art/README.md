# Sprite art direction

The natural and unrestored world uses muted post-apocalyptic rustic colours.
Players, restored assets, and special or sacred places may deliberately introduce
cleaner, brighter or cooler colours. Colour signals care and significance; the
crisp chibi retro pixel style stays consistent in every state.

`art-direction.json` owns the working palette, colour provenance, state rules,
candidate assessments and proposed ruins roles. These are review targets, not a
runtime palette filter. No sprites or spawn rules are changed by this document.

The palette was built from twelve current story paintings. Each contributes an
equal sample: whole landscape paintings, but only the upper 40% of portrait
paintings, excluding the deliberately dark text area. The preview shows the
measured RGB median-cut colours separately from the curated working palette.
Muted foliage, neutral stone and restored accents are authored extensions, not
claimed as direct samples. Exact player cyan and charcoal come from the current
character sprites.

Use the current 16px Cyan character pack as the sprite style anchor: compact
shapes, dark readable contours, sparse intentional pixel clusters and opaque
pixel edges. Copy the paintings' colour relationships, not their detail density.
A soft high-resolution sprite does not become a style match through recolouring.

The strongest next candidates are the existing chunky grass silhouette in olive,
a warm brown mushroom or brick-red spotted cap, `hedge_end.png` for compact bushes,
and the outlined broadleaf trees with quieter olive foliage. Keep teal foliage
for a restored or sacred setting. For ruins, start with `pillar_c.png` and
`pot_smashed.png`; masonry and broken-column candidates need contour review.

Generate both linked review pages and palette exports (Pillow and Node required):

```sh
python3 tools/preview_art_direction.py --output /tmp/art-direction
python3 tools/preview_nature_candidates.py \
  --reserve-root /home/claude/terracart/unused_art --output /tmp/art-direction
```

Outputs include a self-contained palette page, the full candidate gallery, JSON,
a PNG swatch chart, and a GPL palette importable by pixel-art editors. No image
service or generation is involved. Candidates show original source pixels; the
assessments explicitly identify proposed recolours and state-specific uses.
