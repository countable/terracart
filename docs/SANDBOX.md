# Sandbox test world

Load with `?sandbox=true` (e.g. `index.html?sandbox=true`). Replaces the start
tile with a hand-laid **town + countryside** map that packs one of every biome,
interactable, and fauna into a single area you can walk in seconds. Source:
`src/sandbox.js`.

## Why scenes, not swatches

Worldgen never produces a pure "residential square" — a real residential
polygon is a *scene*: a road threads through it, houses (shop type set by the
address digit) line the road, yards carry flora, mineral rocks sit at the curb.
So each test area is a small realistic composite, and the connective **roads**
between them aren't filler — they cover the road / road_lg / road_md / path
biomes and their street-letter overlays.

### Test kit granted on load

- Inventory: ~5 of every item (seeds → produce → animals → minerals → consumables).
- Gear: one of every relic + armor at **T3** — clears every action gate while
  staying *below* the T4–T7 rocks, so the "pickaxe too weak" branch is still
  demonstrable on the high-tier ROCK samples.
- All sandbox houses marked restored so shop sprites + signs render immediately.

## Notes

- Everything is **clobbered on every load** (inventory, gear, planted, released,
  placed rocks) for a predictable baseline.
- Scene-name captions float over each scene (white-on-black) to help orient.
- To extend: add a scene object, drop it into a `BANDS` row, and add its
  coverage to this matrix. The layout (sizes → positions) is computed from the
  scene `w`/`h`, so you never hand-place coordinates.
